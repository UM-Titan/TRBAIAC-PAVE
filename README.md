# TRBAIAC-PAVE
This is the benchmark model for TRB AI Committees Open Data Challenge on pavement distress detection and analysis. Top-down views of pavement image data containing 7 main distress types annotated with bounding boxes are provided (via aiac_main.ipynb). The repo also includes a tutorial on how to train, test models and submit results for evaluation. The modeling framework uses a deep convolutional neural network model with an architecture borrowed from YOLOV5.

## <summary> RULES </summary>
We expect you to respect the spirit of the competition and do not cheat.
* There is no restriction on the size of the team.
* The use of external data is forbidden.
* Manually annotating test datasets is forbidden.
* Pre-trained models are allowed in the competition.
* We encourage teams to share their source codes and trained models. Python Notebooks are desirable for sharing codes.
